SETUP
Replace placeholders in /include/credential.h relative to this directory or complete webpage setup process immediately after flashing (the former is recommended as the latter has a really troublesome timeout period)


DEVELOPMENT
Incorporate local SQL db to store most up to date info on flash and just update there? Could significantly reduce memory usage.
Figure out how to appropriately cite usage of pre-existing calendar codebase (correct licensing info)
